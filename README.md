<h1>**DSA STUDY PLAN
**</h1> </br>

Here's my plan to master DSA. As someone without a CS background, I always find learning difficult. Hence, I decided to self-teach myself by doing Leetcode and study the core concepts in my free time. I plan to devote one to two weeks to each of the DSA topics below.
